\chapter{Database}

The dataset is composd by 8236 stocks from the US stock market, along with
their general informations and historical data; the application also need to store 
users' and admins' credential, personal informationof users, composition and details of
each user's porfolio.
We decided to use a column database for the storage of historical data; those 
informations represent around the 95% of our dataset and they are going to grow very fast
during time; aggaregation and financial analytics on these volumes of data will perform
better in a colum database where data storage is design to optimize this type of operations;
We decided to store every other information in a document database, in order to exploit the
schemaless property for save memory; information frequently needed toghether will be stored 
in the same document and indexes are created to speedup linking beetween documents;

will improve the avaliability of our application. It also suport a lot of analytics functions
and the creation of custom indexes ibn order to speedup read operations;
