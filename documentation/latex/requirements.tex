\chapter{Actors and requirements}
The main actors and the functional requirements are defined based on the previous
simple description of the application. There is also a 
particular actor which is in charge of the automatic update of the dataset; non-functional
requirements are the characteristics that ensure satisfactory interaction with users and 
real world utility of the product.

\section{Actors}
Based on the application design, four actors can interact with the system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{Guest user} is someone who is not registered on the application; this actor does not 
own private credentials for the login; in order to exploit the application main functionalities, 
it has to register a new account. The registration it is the only action allowed for a Guest;

    \item A \textbf{Registered user} is someone who's registered on the application; this actor own
private credentials (username and password) for the login; this actor can login as a user
into the client
application and utilize its main features like watch stocks information, compose portfolios and 
simulate them. 
   
    \item An \textbf{Admin user} is someone who is registered on the application with administration
credentials; this actor can login as an admin into the client and do some maintenance 
operations; this operations includes check the integrity of the entire dataset and add new 
stocks to it;

    \item The \textbf{Data Updater} is a thread running on one server; this thread is suppose to 
run always, and it is in charge of update the dataset with the new information coming from 
the stock market daily sessions; it is also in charge to find and fix (at list report)
integrity issues.

\end{itemize}

The full use case diagram is provided on chapter 3.
\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The user, upon launching the application, should be able to sign-up and sign-in.
	\item The user should be able to search for a ticker and view info about it.
	\item The user should be able to view charts on the history of a ticker.
	\item The user should be able to create and delete portfolios.
	\item The user should be able to add/remove tickers to/from their portfolio.
	\item The user should be able to run simulations on a portfolio.
	\item The user should be able to visualize statistics about a simulation and possibly view charts on them.
	\item Only admins should be able to add new stocks to the database.
	\item Only admins should be able to add other admins.
	\item The software should always provide the most recent data about a ticker.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The retrieval of data about tickers and portfolios should be fast.
	\item User password should be stored in a secure way (i.e. hashed).
\end{itemize}
